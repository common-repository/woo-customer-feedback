Customer feedback service for WooCommerce. Makes surveys and collects data about your service level and ordered products. Adds submenu to the WooCommerce menu. There is no hidden payments or ads inside!

== Description ==

Hi, there!

Did you ever think about how to make your e-commerce service better? If so, our WooCommerce Customer Feedback plugin will help you with that.

The WooCommerce Customer Feedback allows you to collect user's feedback data about product selection, consulting, delivery, payment process and the overall convenience of your services usage.
As well as feedback about the ordered item. After order became "Completed", product feedback email will be automatically sent to the customer, asking to comment ordered item.
One more thing is sending service feedback email, that should be triggered manually with a button from "Edit Order" page (in the administration panel).
Both emails could be sent only once.

Please note that WooCommerce (v.3.1+) must be installed and active.

There is no hidden payments or ads inside!
